# aspose test assignment

Solution is presented as class libraries and unit tests class library.

To obtain more flexibility and reusege code in different parts of a solution, code was separated into projects. Each project contains specific part of classes.

The Architecture of the solution is a prototype of N-tier architecture with an implementation of business logic level with technical services and application level with general entities.
Implemented dependency injection using Autofac to make layers less rigidly connected to each other.
In addition, there are such frameworks as NUnit for unit tests.
Further, in the solution should be implemented logging and caching according to data layer implementation.

Test assignment was made in Visual Studio 2017 and .Net Framework 4.7. 
To run Tests open the solution in visual studio and build. NuGet packages should be automatically downloaded. 
 Open SalaryTests.cs file and Run all tests.
